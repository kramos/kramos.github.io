              <li>From a core SRE perspective you have two levers:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>1. Refine your measurement of service quality so that:</li>
                <li>
                  <ul class="bullets">
                    <li>You more effectively reduce the cost of poor quality changes making it to production and generating a lot of Toil</li>
                    <li>You can potentially lower the quality of your service to make it cheaper to run.  For example if you need a page load time to be 2000ms and it currently loads in 10ms, you might be able to reduce the amount of infrastructure you use.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>2. Focus on reducing Toil i.e. the manual work required to support production (for which the cost of that work could be avoided).</li>
              </ul>
              <li>So go back a step and pick Improve Service Quality or Reduce Toil!</li>
              <li><br/>NB. there are other cost saving levers that impact the above ideas.  For example you may currently run your service with a low day rate outsourced team.  Your strategy may be to reduce Toil and therefore the number of people required, or instead it might be to reduce Toil to the point that your inhouse Engineers can pick it all up cost effectively.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
